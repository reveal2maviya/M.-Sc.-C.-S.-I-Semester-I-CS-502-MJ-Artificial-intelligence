**What is BFS?**
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an uninformed graph traversal algorithm used for systematic exploration of graphs and trees. It begins at the root node (or a specified starting point) and explores all its neighbors before moving on to their neighbors, level by level. Key characteristics of BFS include:
- Ensures that the shortest path is found in unweighted graphs.
- ...
