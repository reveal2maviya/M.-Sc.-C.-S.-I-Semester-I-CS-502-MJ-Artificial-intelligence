**What is Hill Climbing?**
Hill Climbing is a local search optimization algorithm that starts with an initial solution and iteratively makes incremental changes to improve it. The algorithm examines neighboring solutions and selects the one that results in the highest improvement according to an objective or fitness function. Hill climbing is aptly named because it strives to "climb" to the peak, which represents an optimal solution. It is used in optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem and in machine learning to fine-tune model parameters.
