# What is Mean End Analysis?

**What is Mean End Analysis?**
Mean End Analysis is a problem-solving technique that seeks to simplify complex problems by considering intermediate goals. In this approach, an AI agent aims to achieve the "mean" or average of the desired goal state and the current state, making the problem more tractable by breaking it down into smaller, more achievable subgoals. This technique is commonly used in AI planning and problem decomposition, particularly in domains where a problem can be simplified by tackling intermediate objectives.
