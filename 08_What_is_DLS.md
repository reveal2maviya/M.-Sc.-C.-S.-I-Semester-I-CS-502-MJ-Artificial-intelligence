**What is DLS?**
Depth-Limited Search (DLS) is a variation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm that limits the exploration to a specified depth level. This limitation is useful to prevent infinite loops and over-exploration in graphs that may contain cycles. DLS is employed in scenarios where controlling the depth of search is important, such as chess endgame analysis or web crawling to avoid excessive depth in websites.
