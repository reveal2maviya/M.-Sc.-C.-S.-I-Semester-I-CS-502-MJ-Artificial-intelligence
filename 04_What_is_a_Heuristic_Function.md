**What is a Heuristic Function?**
A heuristic function is a domain-specific function used in informed search algorithms to estimate the cost or distance from a current state to a goal state. For example, in pathfinding problems, heuristics provide a "rule of thumb" to guide the search algorithm. In the A* algorithm, the heuristic function, often denoted as h(n), is essential for efficiently estimating the cost from the current node to the goal node. Common heuristic functions include Euclidean distance in 2D grids or Manhattan distance. A well-designed heuristic can significantly impact the search efficiency.
