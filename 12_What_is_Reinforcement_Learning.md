# What is Reinforcement Learning?

**What is Reinforcement Learning?**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make a sequence of decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment, taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The agent's objective is to learn a policy that guides its actions to maximize the expected cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is widely used in applications like game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics, and autonomous control systems.
