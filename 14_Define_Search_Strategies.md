# Define Search Strategies.

**Define Search Strategies**
Search strategies outline the systematic plans or algorithms employed to explore a problem space in search problems. Key search strategies include:
i. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores nodes in a level-wise manner, guaranteeing the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
ii. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Delves as deeply as possible along a branch before backtracking.
iii. **A* Algorithm:** Utilizes informed search and heuristics to find optimal paths.
iv. **Best-First Search:** Prioritizes nodes based on heuristic estimates.
v. **Greedy Search:** Selects the most promising path based on heuristic information.
vi. **IDA* (Iterative-Deepening A*):** An iterative version of A* designed to reduce memory requirements.
vii. **DLS (Depth-Limited Search):** Restricts the depth of exploration in search problems.
viii. **Bidirectional Search:** Simultaneously searches from the start and goal states to find the shortest path.
