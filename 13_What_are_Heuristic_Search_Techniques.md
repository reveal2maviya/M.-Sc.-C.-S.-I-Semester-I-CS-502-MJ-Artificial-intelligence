# What are Heuristic Search Techniques?

**What are Heuristic Search Techniques?**
Heuristic search techniques refer to a class of algorithms that utilize heuristic functions to guide the search for solutions in complex problems. These techniques are characterized by the use of heuristic estimates to determine which paths to explore. Examples include:
- **A* Algorithm:** Combines informed search with heuristics to efficiently explore a problem space.
- **Best-First Search:** Prioritizes nodes based on heuristic estimates.
