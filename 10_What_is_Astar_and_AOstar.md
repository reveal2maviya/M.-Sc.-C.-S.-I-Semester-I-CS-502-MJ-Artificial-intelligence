# What is A* and AO*?

**What is A* and AO*?**
A* (A-Star) is an informed search algorithm used for pathfinding and optimization. It combines elements of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and heuristics. In A*, nodes are expanded based on a combination of two factors: the cost to reach the node from the starting point and a heuristic estimate of the cost from the node to the goal. A* is widely used in applications where finding the shortest path is essential, such as robotics and navigation systems.

**AO* (A-Star Optimization)** is an extension of A* that incorporates additional optimization techniques to improve efficiency, making it particularly suitable for large-scale problems.
